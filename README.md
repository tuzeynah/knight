Minecraft ghost client made in C++

This project was created as a learning exercise in C++, using [Fusion](https://github.com/6470bru/fusion) as a base.
However, compared to Fusion, it has been significantly optimized and thoroughly tested for practical use

Compatible with Lunar Client versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9, featuring a wide range of combat, visual, and utility modules.
